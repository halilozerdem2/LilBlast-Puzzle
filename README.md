If you still see broken images in preview, make sure you're viewing the root README.md (not Readme/README.md) and that the ScreenShoots folder is in the repository root. You can also view an individual image directly at `https://github.com/halilozerdem2/LilBlast-Puzzle/raw/main/ScreenShoots/1.png` to confirm it's present.
